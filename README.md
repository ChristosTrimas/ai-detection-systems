# Introduction

This repository contains the source code and usefull files for my thesis, with title "Comparison of Artficial Intelligence Systems for the detection of objects on UAV images".
Various known object detection models will be compared with traditional techniques of Machine Learning. The goal is to make a comparison of such systems in the Stanford Drone Dataset and particulary to detect pedestrians (class renamed as Person).

# Models

- RetinaNet: A well-known single-stage detector, RetinaNet uses a Feature Pyramid Network or FPN on top of a ResNet, as backbone. To the FPN, tow Fully Connected Networks are attached, one for classification and one for bounding box reggresion. The authors of RetinaNet, introduced Focal Loss, a modified Cross Entropy Loss function, that performs better than CE for dense objects.
