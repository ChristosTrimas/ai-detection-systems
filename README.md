# Introduction

This repository contains the source code and usefull files for my thesis, with title "Comparison of Artficial Intelligence Systems for the detection of objects on UAV images".
Various known object detection models will be compared with traditional techniques of Machine Learning. The goal is to make a comparison of such systems in the Stanford Drone Dataset and particulary to detect pedestrians (class renamed as Person).
