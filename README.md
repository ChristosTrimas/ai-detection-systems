# Introduction

This repository contains the source code and usefull files for my thesis, with title "Comparison of Artficial Intelligence Systems for the detection of objects on UAV images".

# Object Detection

- soon

# Models

- RetinaNet: A well-known single-stage detector, RetinaNet uses a Feature Pyramid Network or FPN on top of a ResNet, as backbone. To the FPN, tow Fully Connected Networks are attached, one for classification and one for bounding box reggresion. The authors of RetinaNet, introduced Focal Loss, a modified Cross Entropy Loss function, that performs better than CE for dense objects.

More about RetinaNet soon.
