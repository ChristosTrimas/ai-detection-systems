"Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Systems for the detection of objects on UAV-based images".

# Introduction

Umanned Aerial Vehicles is an aircraft without a pilot, crew or passengers, originally developed for military missions too "dull or dangerous" for humans. The development of cameras and the general miniaturization of applicable technologies, helped UAVs to become extremely popular in the late 80s. Drones nowadays, have various military, civilian and commercial applications. With extensive cost reduction in electronics, the defence forces around the globe are utilizing UAVs for applications such as logistics, communications, attack and combat, while commercial applications include aerial photography and filmaking, cargo transport and detection of disasters. But the most common use of UAVs is surveilance. Whether it comes to the detection of waves of refugees, guard a prison or gather information about a battlefield, UAVs have prove their usefulness. A significant contribution to this development played the evolution of deep learning and object detectors.

# Models

- RetinaNet: A well-known single-stage detector, RetinaNet uses a Feature Pyramid Network or FPN on top of a ResNet, as backbone. To the FPN, tow Fully Connected Networks are attached, one for classification and one for bounding box reggresion. The authors of RetinaNet, introduced Focal Loss, a modified Cross Entropy Loss function, that performs better than CE for dense objects.
